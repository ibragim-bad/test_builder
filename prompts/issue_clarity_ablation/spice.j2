# GitHub Issue Specification Classifier

**Task:** Classify the issue as **well-specified** (0-1) or **underspecified** (2-3) based on whether precise test assertions can be derived.

{% set title, description = problem_statement.split(&#x27;\n&#x27;, maxsplit=1) -%}
Issue Title: {{ title }}
Issue Description: {{ description }}

## Core Criteria (Testability-Driven)

### **Well-Specified (0-1)**
- **0 (Fully Testable):**
  - ✅ **Repro Code:** Executable snippet to trigger the issue.
  - ✅ **Explicit Success Criteria:** "Should return X," "Must raise Y."
  - ✅ **No Ambiguity:** Single, clear resolution path.


- **1 (Testable with Minor Assumptions):**
  - ✅ **Core Problem + Repro:** Clear issue + partial repro code.
  - ❌ **Missing:** Edge cases or explicit success criteria.
  - **Example:**


### **Underspecified (2-3)**
- **2 (Ambiguous):**
  - ❌ **Multiple Solutions:** "Either fix X or Y" without justification.
  - ❌ **Unclear Success:** "Improve performance" without metrics.
  - **Example:**


- **3 (Non-Actionable):**
  - ❌ **No Technical Details:** "Fix this bug."
  - ❌ **External Context:** Relies on unexplained images/links.


## Decision Flow
1. **Is it 0?**
   - Check for **all three**: repro code, expected behaviour, no ambiguity.
2. **Is it 1?**
   - Has **repro + core problem** but needs minor assumptions.
3. **Is it 2?**
   - Suggests **multiple fixes** or has **unclear success criteria**.
4. **Default to 3:**
   - No repro, error logs, or design specifics.

Candidate Solution:
- Does the issue include hints, outlines, or partial solutions?
- Is there any specific code snippet or description that suggests how to address the problem?

## Final Classification

Output Requirements:

Return only a JSON object with the following structure (no additional text or formatting):
```json
{
  "explanation": "<Tie to testability criteria>",
  "score": <well-specified|underspecified>,
  "candidate_solution": <true or false>
}
Ensure that the JSON is complete and properly formatted, using lowercase true or false for booleans.
In the "explanation" field of the JSON, *show your full reasoning* that is **thorough** and **focused**—cover every decision step. Highlight edge cases or assumptions, and **avoid repetition or filler**.</pre>
