You are an expert DevOps/build engineer. Your task is to generate a minimal, reusable base Dockerfile for projects written in <LANG_NAME>.

Goal
Create a base image that contains the runtime/toolchain and common system dependencies needed to:
1) install project dependencies,
2) build/compile the project (if applicable),
3) run the project's test suite.

Scope and constraints
- This is a *base* image used across many repositories, so avoid repository-specific assumptions.
- Prefer official or widely used upstream base images for <LANG_NAME> (e.g., official images on Docker Hub) rather than installing the toolchain from scratch.
- Target linux/amd64 unless <LANG_NAME> strongly requires otherwise.
- Use only system packages that are broadly useful (git, curl, ca-certificates, build tools, common native libs). Avoid adding uncommon services.
- Do not add project source code, do not run project commands, and do not require network access at runtime beyond typical dependency installation.

Required contents
1) A suitable FROM line (prefer a stable, commonly used toolchain version; choose an LTS/stable version when possible).
2) Installation of common build and debugging utilities:
   - git, curl/wget, unzip/zip, ca-certificates
   - build-essential / compiler toolchain, pkg-config, cmake (if relevant)
3) Installation of native libraries commonly required by packages in this ecosystem (keep this conservative).
4) Environment variables that place language/package-manager caches under /workspace (so they are writable even for non-root):
   - Set XDG_CACHE_HOME, XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_DATA_HOME when applicable
   - Also set language-specific cache/home vars (e.g., for package managers)
5) Create a non-root user (but keep USER optional, as a commented line).
6) WORKDIR /workspace.

Output requirements
- Return only the Dockerfile contents, and nothing else (no explanation, no markdown).
- Keep the Dockerfile reasonably short and readable.
- Clean apt caches (rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*) to reduce image size.

Example style (Elixir)
[The following is only an example of the expected style and structure; do not copy it verbatim.]

FROM --platform=linux/amd64 elixir:1.16
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV TZ=Etc/UTC
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    git curl wget unzip zip ca-certificates \
    build-essential pkg-config cmake gnupg \
    libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libgmp-dev libffi-dev \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
ENV MIX_HOME=/workspace/.mix \
    HEX_HOME=/workspace/.hex \
    XDG_CACHE_HOME=/workspace/.cache \
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/workspace/.config \
    XDG_DATA_HOME=/workspace/.local/share
RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos 'nonroot' nonroot
# USER nonroot
WORKDIR /workspace

Now generate the base Dockerfile for {{lang}}
